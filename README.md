# TCC-programming-class-projects
### Project brief description
In this repository, it will include projects, assignments, or programs I have to do for my TCC programming classes. The programs will be written in C++. This is to not only help organize my files but to also show my C++ ability.

### Why is this on Github?
It is in here to organize my codes. It is far easier to put it on here then to indivually save it locally on my computer. Also since I work across different devices, it is easier to work on my code. For an example, on IOS mobile, I can actually see my code where orginally it's not possible when I look at my file app.
